vdf-json-java
=============

Class to convert Valve Data Format files to JSON format.

Only thing it supports now is the key/value pairs, and even then, it handles those pretty horribly.

[Single source file for it](https://github.com/nosoop/vdf-json-java/blob/master/VDF-JSON/src/com/nosoop/json/VDF.java) -- a copy of the json.org reference library is also bundled.

Released under the MIT license.
